The seat of power was then passed on to the Indian kingdom of Funan closely followed by the Hindu kingdom of Champa. Soon after, the Chinese Han Empire annexed the country during the first millennium B.C. and was expelled from the country in 939 A.D after Vietnamese had a major victory over them the Bach Dang River. Later being ruled by a succession of kings and invasion by French and Spanish forces, the country went through a rebellion under the leadership of Ho Chih Minh, who declared its independence in 1945.\n",
